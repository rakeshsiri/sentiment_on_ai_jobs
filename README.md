## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using stackoverflow.com's 2018 survey data to have a better understanding about the general sentiment around the field of Data Science/AI by answering the following 6 questions.

1. Who(country) pays top dollar?
2. Are you satisfied with your job?
3. How does one feel about the future of AI?
4. What area in AI is more interesting?
5. But what about the threat AI poses?
6. Who should take responsibility in preventing the AI apocalypse?
